# Harder Hardcore

Mega Hard Core is a mod that makes the game significantly harder and longer.  
The name of the mod may change later, I don't have much inspiration.

## Features

### Crafting Recipes

- Logs give 3 planks instead of 4
- Stone tools must be crafted from flint instead of cobblestone
- Food cannot be cooked in regular furnaces, the player must use smokers or campfires
- Iron and gold smelt in regular furnaces give nuggets instead of ingots
- The cooking time in blast furnaces and smokers is identical to the cooking time in regular furnaces
- Netherite upgrades can no longer be duplicated

### Loots

- Iron golems drops iron nuggets instead of ingots
- Sheep drop strings instead of wool

### Monsters

- Hostile creatures deal more damage and have more health during new moon nights and below y < 0
- Leader zombies are slightly bigger and deal more damage

### Death

- Advancements progress, unlocked recipes, statistics are deleted on player death
- Ender chest inventory is cleared on death

## Planned features

- Campfire gives regeneration effect
